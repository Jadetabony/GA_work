# GA Data Science Final Project and Data

### Question
Many people want to be aware of what politicians are actually writing in their bills, but the prospect of reading the wordy, lengthy bills that are scripted in political jargon may prove a road block for people.  I'm interested in building a tool that distills the large bills into a more condensed form, highlighting parts of particular concern. I also hope to use text analytics to identify trends in bills.

For my project, I plan to collect data about US Congressional bills written and voted on in the last 50 years.  This dataset will be acquired using [the congressional API](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api) and scraping the full text of the bills.

Using this data, I intend to use text analytics to answer the following questions:

- Can the bill author's be identified as Republican or Democrat, using text analytics?
- Can a tool be built to use text analytics and voting records to predict the likelihood that a bill will be passed?
- Can text analytics be used to identify bills that infringe on human rights issues, such as LGBT discrimination, racism or female reproductive rights?


### Dataset

My data will be collected from [the congressional API](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api).  If collecting bill text proves difficult before a certain year, scope of the project will be limited.
